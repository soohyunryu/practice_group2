He's very small, Abby’s Mom said as she peered at the tiny\n
water snail. Abby said that he would grow and then pulled her\n
pajama bottoms up again before she got into bed, for they\n
were always falling down. Usually, Abby’s Mom got up at the\n
crack of dawn, but it was Abby who jumped out of bed first the\n
next morning and switched on the light in her fish tank,\n
which contained three fish. At first, she could see neither\n
hide nor hair of the snail, but then she spotted him. It had\n
taken Abby a while to find Sticky because he was clinging to\n`,
`the glass near the bottom, right next to the gravel. At\n
school that day, Abby, encouraged by her teacher wrote\n
excitedly about the small and mysterious Mr. Sticky who you\n
could mistake for a piece of gravel. He seemed an ideal pet\n
for her – some of the girls in her class teased – because\n
Abby was also very small. That evening, Abby turned on the\n
light and found Mr. Sticky clinging to the pondweed and\n
bobbing about in the air bubbles. That looks fun! Abby\n
exclaimed. She tried to imagine what it must be like to have\n
to hang on to things all day and decided the answer was that it\n`,
`was probably very tiring. Abby told her Mom that she thought\n
Sticky had grown a bit the next day at breakfast. Just as well\n
if he's going to be gobbled up like that, her Mom responded,\n
who was busy preparing breakfast. Abby whined that she\n
didn’t want him to get too big or he wouldn’t be cute\n
anymore. “Small things, not big things are cute, right?"\n
she asked, half to herself. The next day in art class, Abby\n
needed two pieces of paper that were very expensive to draw\n
an elephant, but the teacher didn't mind Abby using the\n
expensive paper because she was pleased with the drawing and\n`,
`wanted it on the wall. The teacher, who was always very\n
encouraging, remarked that the drawing Abby had made was\n
very creative and beamed at Abby, giving her the seal of\n
approval. Back at home, Mom, convinced by Abby to clean out\n
the tank was cleaning with a special vacuum, or\n
“hoover.” Where's Mr. Sticky? Abby asked first thing\n
when she came home from school. On the side, Mom replied. And\n
then she added, "Don't worry I went extra slowly since it’s\n
better to be safe than sorry." Abby looked on all sides of the\n
tank but there was no sign of the water snail that she had\n`,
`discovered a couple of days ago. She was very sad. Her Mom\n
said to wait a few hours until the water clears to take\n
another careful look. That evening, Abby went up to her\n
bedroom to check the tank again. The water had settled and\n
looked clear but Abby could not see Mr. Sticky. Abby kneeled\n
down to have another look in the tank that her Mom had cleared\n
so thoroughly, but Mr. Sticky was still nowhere to be found.\n
Abby was a bundle of nerves as she descended the stairs. In\n
the study surrounded by books and papers her mom was working\n
and she looked impatient when she saw Abby in the doorway and\n`,
`even more worried when she heard the bad news. He'll turn up,\n
Mom said, and that was that. Then, to add fuel to the flames,\n
she raised her tone of voice and said dismissively, "For the\n
time being, go to bed, Abby. I've got masses of work to catch\n
up on." Abby had a quick temper and she was angry as hell.\n
You've hoovered him up, haven't you? she said accusingly.\n
Abby’s Mom denied Abby’s version of the story was true\n
and said that she was careful, but because Mr. Sticky was so\n
small he was hard to see. What's wrong with being small?\n
"Nothing at all, but it makes things hard to find.” Or\n`,
`notice,"" Abby said, suddenly feeling like the small,\n
overlooked Mr. Sticky herself and storming from the room."\n
The door to the bedroom opened a few minutes later and Mom's\n
face appeared. She was there to try to make up for having been\n
insensitive earlier. She had put her work on the back burner\n
and occupied herself with Sticky. Abby, who was breathing\n
fire all on account of the little snail, tried to ignore her\n
but it was hard when Mom walked over to the bed and sat next to\n
her Mom, who Abby still strained to remain upset with, had\n
gone out to find her glasses in order to search for Sticky\n`,
`more effectively. This is my new and extra powerful pair I\n
have for important occasions like snail hunting, she said.\n
She smiled at Abby, trying to butter her up, but Abby\n
didn’t smile back. Abby believed her mom’s idea would\n
not succeed, but then she had an idea of her own. I've got a\n
magnifying glass, Abby suddenly remembered and rushed off\n
to find it. On the floor beside each other they sat,\n
shuffling around the tank, looking all over the place and\n
peering into the corners among the big pebbles and the\n
pondweed. Abby tried to imagine, if she were Sticky, a little\n`,
`water snail, where would she hide out? At one point she\n
thought she saw him, but it wasn’t the water snail. It was a\n
large speck of dust that was deceptively bobbing around in\n
the water like a live animal. They were ready to call it\n
quits, when suddenly Mom cried, "Ah ha!" Tucked in a curve of\n
the archway, perfectly hidden against a pitch dark stone,\n
sat Mr. Sticky, safe and sound. “You, I can always count\n
on,” Abby said to her mom, with relief. Then she noticed\n
another water snail was right next to Sticky and asked where\n
this new addition to the family could have come from. I'm\n`,
`beginning to suspect the pond weed is guilty, don't you\n
think? replied Mom. They both laughed and climbed into\n
Abby's bed together and though it was cozy, it was a bit of a\n
squeeze. Budge up, Mom said, giving Abby a push with her\n
bottom. I can't because I'm already on the edge. "Good\n
heavens, you've grown then. When did that happen? You\n
could’ve put an elephant in here last time we did this.\n
Before I know it, you’ll be all grown up." On her mom's\n
chest Abby then put her head and smiled.`];
