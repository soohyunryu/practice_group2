var story8_split =[`Tulip mania was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which\n
contract prices for bulbs of the recently introduced tulip\n
reached extraordinarily high levels and then suddenly\n
collapsed. At the peak of tulip mania in February sixteen\n
thirty-seven, tulip contracts sold for more than ten times\n
the annual income of a skilled craftsman. It is generally\n
considered the first recorded economic bubble. The tulip,\n
introduced to Europe in the mid sixteenth century from the\n
Ottoman Empire, became very popular in the United\n
Provinces, which we now know as the Netherlands. Tulip\n`,
`cultivation in the United Provinces is generally thought to\n
have started in earnest around fifteen ninety-three after\n
the Flemish botanist Charles de l'Écluse had taken up a post\n
at the University of Leiden and established a botanical\n
garden, which is famous as one of the oldest in the world.\n
There, he planted his collection of tulip bulbs, that the\n
Emperor's ambassador sent to him from Turkey, which were\n
able to tolerate the harsher conditions of the northern\n
climate. It was shortly thereafter that the tulips began to\n
grow in popularity. The flower rapidly became a coveted\n`,
`luxury item and a status symbol, and a profusion of varieties\n
followed. They were classified in groups: one-colored\n
tulips of red, yellow, or white were known as Couleren, but\n
it was the multicolored Rosen (red or pink on white\n
background), Violetten (purple or lilac on white\n
background), and, to a lesser extent, the Bizarden (red,\n
brown or purple on yellow background) that were the most\n
popular. These spectacular and highly sought-after tulip\n
bulbs would grow flowers with vivid colors, lines, and\n
flames on the petals, as a result, it is now understood, of\n`,
`being infected with tulip-specific virus known as the\n
"Tulip breaking virus". The Dutch Golden Age growers named\n
their new varieties with exalted titles. Many early forms\n
were prefixed with "admiral", often combined with the\n
growers' names. “General" was another prefix that found\n
its way into the names of around thirty varieties. Later came\n
varieties with even more superb names, such as even "Admiral\n
of Admirals" and "General of Generals". Most of these\n
varieties have now died out, though similar "broken" tulips\n
continue in the trade. Tulips grow from bulbs, and can be\n`,
`propagated through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip\n
will form a flowering bulb after seven-twelve years. When a\n
bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will\n
disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several\n
buds. Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of\n
their own. The “tulip breaking” virus, which many\n
botanists have studied, spreads only through buds, not\n
seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties\n
takes years. Propagation is greatly slowed down by the\n
virus. Tulips bloom in April and May for about a week, and the\n`,
`secondary buds appear shortly thereafter. Bulbs can be\n
uprooted and moved about from June to September, and thus\n
actual purchases occurred during these months. As the\n
flowers grew in popularity, professional growers paid\n
higher and higher prices for bulbs with the virus. By sixteen\n
thirty-four, in part as a result of demand from the French,\n
speculators began to enter the market. In sixteen\n
thirty-six, the Dutch created a type of formal futures\n
markets which merchants used to sell and buy contracts to buy\n
bulbs at the end of the season. Traders met at taverns and\n`,
`buyers were required to pay a fee per trade. People were\n
purchasing bulbs at higher and higher prices, intending to\n
re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not\n
last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high\n
prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February sixteen\n
thirty-seven, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers\n
willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their\n
bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips\n
collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble\n
burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips\n`,
`at prices now ten times greater than those on the open\n
market, while others found themselves in possession of\n
bulbs now worth a fraction of the price they had paid. The\n
event was popularized in eighteen forty-one by the book\n
Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,\n
that a British journalist Charles Mackay wrote. That crowds\n
of people often behave irrationally was the main thesis of\n
the book, and tulip mania was one of the primary examples.\n
According to Mackay, at one point twelve acres of land were\n
offered for a Semper Augustus bulb. He claims that many such\n`,
`investors ruined by the fall in prices were desperate, and\n
Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. In Mackay's\n
account, the panicked tulip speculators sought help from\n
the government of the Netherlands, which responded by\n
declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase\n
bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a\n
ten percent fee. Attempts that were made to resolve the\n
situation to the satisfaction of all parties were\n
unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with\n
individuals stuck with the bulbs they held at the end of the\n`,
`crash. No court would enforce payment of a contract, since\n
judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling,\n
and thus not enforceable by law. Although Mackay's book is a\n
classic that many publishing houses continue reprinting\n
today, his account is contested. Many modern scholars\n
believe the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay\n
described, with some arguing that the price changes may not\n
have constituted a bubble. Research on the tulip mania is\n
difficult because of the limited data from the sixteen\n
thirties. However, some modern economists have proposed\n`,
`rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania,\n
for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers,\n
such as the hyacinth, also had high prices on the flower's\n
introduction, which then fell dramatically. The high\n
prices may also have been driven by expectations of a\n
parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a\n
small cost, thus lowering the risk to buyers. Despite these\n
disagreements about whether the phenomenon technically\n
constituted an economic bubble, the term "tulip mania" is\n
still often used metaphorically to refer to any large\n`,
`economic bubble, when asset prices deviate from intrinsic\n
values.`];
