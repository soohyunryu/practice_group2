var story9_split =[`Tourette’s syndrome, a neurological disorder\n
characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements, was\n
named for Dr. Georges Gilles de la Tourette, the pioneering\n
French neurologist who first described the condition in an\n
eighty-six-year-old French noblewoman. It is almost always\n
in childhood that the early symptoms of Tourette’s are\n
first noticed, with the average onset between the ages of\n
seven and ten years. It is estimated that two hundred\n
thousand Americans have the most severe form of\n
Tourette’s, and as many as one in a hundred people exhibit\n`,
`milder and less complex symptoms that include chronic motor\n
and vocal tics or transient tics of childhood. For the\n
majority of people diagnosed with the disorder,\n
Tourette’s is not a chronic condition with symptoms\n
lasting a lifetime. Rather it is a condition whose severity\n
peaks in the early teens, with improvement occurring in the\n
late teens and continuing into adulthood. However,\n
approximately ten percent of those affected have a\n
progressive or disabling course that lasts into adulthood.\n
It is not uncommon for symptoms to be present for an extended\n`,
`period of time before a formal diagnosis of Tourette’s is\n
obtained. The reasons for this are many and may include the\n
fact that for families and physicians unfamiliar with\n
Tourette’s, mild and even moderate tic symptoms may be\n
considered inconsequential, part of a developmental phase,\n
or the result of another condition. For example, parents may\n
think that eye blinking is related to vision problems or that\n
sniffing is related to seasonal allergies. There are many\n
patients who are self-diagnosed after they, their parents,\n
other relatives, or friends read or hear about Tourette’s\n`,
`from others. Tics are classified as either simple or\n
complex. Simple motor tics are sudden, brief, repetitive\n
movements that involve a limited number of muscle groups.\n
Some of the more common simple tics include eye blinking,\n
facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head or shoulder\n
jerking. Simple vocalizations, which motor tics typically\n
precede, might include repetitive throat-clearing,\n
sniffing, or grunting sounds. Complex tics are distinct,\n
coordinated patterns of movement that involve several\n
muscle groups. Complex motor tics might include facial\n`,
`grimacing combined with a head twist and a shoulder shrug.\n
Other complex motor tics may actually appear purposeful,\n
including sniffing or touching objects, hopping, jumping,\n
bending, or twisting. Complex vocal tics include words or\n
phrases. Perhaps the most dramatic and disabling tics\n
include motor movements that result in self-harm such as\n
punching oneself in the face or vocal tics including\n
coprolalia, which involves uttering swear words, or\n
echolalia, which involves repeating the words or phrases of\n
others. Tics are often worse with excitement or anxiety and\n`,
`better during calm, focused activities. Certain physical\n
experiences can trigger or worsen tics. For example, tight\n
collars may trigger neck tics, or hearing another person\n
sniff or throat-clear may trigger the production of similar\n
sounds. Tics come and go over time, varying in type,\n
frequency, location, and severity. The first symptoms\n
Tourette’s patients experience usually occur in the head\n
and neck area, though they may progress to include muscles of\n
the trunk and extremities. The symptoms of Tourette’s are\n
involuntary, but there are some people who can sometimes\n`,
`suppress, camouflage, or otherwise manage their tics in an\n
effort to minimize their impact on functioning. However,\n
people affected by Tourette’s often report a substantial\n
buildup in tension when suppressing their tics to the point\n
where they often feel that the tic must be expressed. Tics in\n
response to an environmental trigger can appear to be\n
voluntary or purposeful but are not. Many people with\n
Tourette’s experience additional neurobehavioral\n
problems that include inattention, hyperactivity and\n
impulsivity. People with Tourette’s have also reported\n`,
`problems with depression or anxiety disorders, as well as\n
other difficulties Tourette’s syndrome may or may not\n
directly cause. Tourette’s is a diagnosis doctors make\n
after verifying that the patient has had both motor and vocal\n
tics for at least one year. The existence of other\n
neurological or psychiatric conditions can also help\n
doctors establish the diagnosis of Tourette’s is the\n
correct one. Knowledgeable clinicians consulted by\n
patients do not often misdiagnose common tics. However,\n
atypical symptoms or atypical presentation such as onset of\n`,
`symptoms in adulthood may require specialty expertise for\n
diagnosis. There are no blood or laboratory tests needed for\n
diagnosis. However, neuroimaging studies, which include\n
magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography, and\n
electroencephalograms, as well as certain lab tests may be\n
used to rule out other conditions that Tourette’s might be\n
confused with. In terms of the role of genes in the disorder,\n
evidence from twin and family studies suggests that\n
Tourette’s is an inherited disorder. Although early\n
family studies suggested an autosomal dominant mode of\n`,
`inheritance characterized the condition, more recent\n
studies discovered the pattern of inheritance was much more\n
complex. Although there may be a few genes that have\n
substantial effects, it’s also possible that many genes\n
with smaller effects and environmental factors may play a\n
role in the development of Tourette’s. Genetic studies\n
also suggest that some forms of Attention Deficit\n
Hyperactivity Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\n
are genetically related to Tourette’s, but there is less\n
evidence for a genetic relationship between Tourette’s\n`,
`and other neurobehavioral problems that Tourette’s\n
commonly co-occurs with. An important role in Tourette’s\n
gene expression is played by the sex of the person. In\n
particular, males affected by the gene are more likely to\n
have tics and females who have a genetic predisposition are\n
more likely to have obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Much\n
current research is aimed at better understanding the\n
genetic basis and symptomatology of Tourette’s, as well\n
as its relationship to related disorders. The hope is that\n
this research leads to better diagnostic tools and better\n`,
`treatments for Tourette’s.`];
